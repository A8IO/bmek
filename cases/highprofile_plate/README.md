# BMEK High-Profile Case with Plate

The new version of the BMEK Case (not tested yet). Exported using Fusion360 into the various file formats.
Note that all files in here each include several components:
- Top half of case 
- Bottom half of the case
- Plate for mounting switches
- The screws for mounting the Plate halfs together
- The screws for mounting the plate to the top half
- The screws for mounting the PCB to the top half (using these is optional, but recommended when mounting the switches with hot-swap sockets)

The screws are 5x M2.5x8 (McMaster-Carr #91290A102) + 20x M2x4 (McMaster-Carr #91290A011) (10x for mounting plate, 10x for the optional PCB mounting).

The number of screws is probably overkill.
